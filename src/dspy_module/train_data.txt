A fair six-sided die is rolled. What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 4?
The possible outcomes when rolling a fair six-sided die are \( \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \). The outcomes that are greater than 4 are \( \{5, 6\} \). Therefore, there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
!!!
\[ P(\text{number greater than 4}) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]

A box contains 3 red balls and 2 blue balls. If two balls are drawn at random without replacement, what is the probability that both balls are red?
!!!
The total number of ways to draw 2 balls from 5 balls is given by the combination formula \( \binom{5}{2} \).
\[ \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10 \]
The number of ways to draw 2 red balls from 3 red balls is given by \( \binom{3}{2} \).
\[ \binom{3}{2} = \frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \frac{3 \times 2}{2 \times 1} = 3 \]
Therefore, the probability that both balls drawn are red is:
\[ P(\text{both red}) = \frac{\text{Number of ways to draw 2 red balls}}{\text{Total number of ways to draw 2 balls}} = \frac{3}{10} \]
